DeFi
----------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction


DeFi: movement, aims at making a new financial system that is open to everyone & doesn't require trusting intermediaries
main bldg blocks of DeFi: smart contracts

makerDAO: one of the first projects that started DeFi movement
          allowed users to lock in ETH as collateral & generate DAI

parts of DeFi:
 lending & borrowing, stable coins, Dexes, derivatives, margin trading, insurance

lending & borrowing
	projects: makerDAO, compound, AAVE
stable coins (2 types)
	algorithmic: with use of smart contracts & incentives, value is pegged to a fiat currency (eg DAI)
	non-algorithmic: centralized, a company holds the equivalent of the value of stable coin as fiat currency (eg USDC, USDT)
decentralized exchanges
	allows exchanging crypto assets in completely decentralized & permissionless way, without giving up custody of the coins
	2 types of dexes:
	a. liquidity pool based (eg. uniswap)
	b. order book based (eg. loopring, idex)
derivatives
	contracts that derive their value from the performance of an underlying asset
	eg. project: synthetix - allows on-chain exposure to different assets
margin trading
	practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in a certain asset
	projects: dy/dx, fulcrum
insurance
	guarantees of compensation in return of the payment of a premium
	eg. protection against smart contract failures, protection of deposits
	eg project: nexus mutual

the above parts can be combined together in multiple various ways

Yield Farming

yield farming: way of maximizing rate of return on capital, by leveraging different DeFi protocols
			   yield farmers try to chase the highest yield, by swtiching btw multiple different strategies
APY (Annulaised Percentage Yield): common way of expressing returns of various yield farming strategies

Three main components that make insane high returns possible on yield farming
	1. Liquidity mining
			liquidity mining is the process of distributing tokens to the users of a protocol
			creates additional incentives for yield farmers as token rewards are added on top of yield already being generated by protocol usage
			depending on the protocol, the incentive may be so high that farmers may be willing to lose on their initial capital just to gain reward tokens, that make the overall strategy highly profitable
	2. Leverage
			using borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment
			farmers borrow coins by depositing some other coins as collateral. Then further use borrowed coins as collateral to borrow some other coins. Repeat this a few times. By doing so farmers generate greater returns on their initial capital
	3. Risk
			yield farming is high risk high reward 

Yield farming strategies: set of steps that aim at generating high yield on the capital. These steps involve atleast one of the following:
	1. Lending & borrowing
		eg. farmers can supply DAI/USDC to a lending platform & start getting returns on their capital. Liquidity mining & leverage can superchage that.
	2. Supplying capital to liquidity pools
		yield farmers can supply coins to one of the liquidity pools in protocols like uniswap & get rewarded with fees that are charged for swapping different tokens. Again liquidity mining can supercharge this.
	3. Staking LP (liquidity provider) tokens
		LP tokens: represent participation in a liquidity pool
		some protocols allow liquidity providers to stake their LP tokens
	strategies can be combined to maximise yield even further
	yield farming strategies can become obsolete very quickly
