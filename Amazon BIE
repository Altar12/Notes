I worked as a Business Intel Engineer Intern at Amazon.
I worked with the team that handled "Amazon Business" related data for all of the Amazon marketplaces (eg. India, US, UK, DE).
As an intern I was assigned the project of building a dashboard using which the marketing team can monitor the performance of their product campaigns on various Amazon websites. 
The project involved designing algorithm to convert tables to type2 format and implementing it, writing SQL code for fetching the data and transforming it to the desired format, setting up the jobs to execute the scripts, writing scripts for data validation, requirements gathering and desgining the dashboard.
At the end of the internship, I had to demo my project to my team, and to the marketing folks.
